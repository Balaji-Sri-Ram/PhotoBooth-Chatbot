# PhotoBooth‑Chatbot

**PhotoBooth‑Chatbot** is a simple yet interactive chatbot that runs via a web interface, allowing users to chat and get responses in a user-friendly setting.

##  What purpose does this website serve?

- Provides a fun and engaging way for users to interact with a chatbot.
- Demonstrates the integration of frontend interfaces with a backend conversational bot.
- Serves as a learning project for building web-based chat applications.

##  How it works

- The user interacts via a web page interface.
- Inputs (messages) are captured by frontend code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and sent to the backend.
- The backend script (`app.py`) processes the input and returns a response.
- The chatbot's responses are dynamically displayed back in the chat window for a seamless experience.
